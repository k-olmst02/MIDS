## Overview
MIDS is a host-based intrusion detection system designed by the students of the University of Michigan - Flint to monitor activity on an individual Linux host, detect suspicious behavior, and generate security alerts. The system focuses on log collection, rule-based detection, and secure evidence stoarge, rather than intrusion prevention. 

## Project Goals 
- Monitor host-level activity for signs of malicious or unauthorized behavior
- Detect and alert on high-confidence security events
- Preserve the integrity of collected forensic evidence

### Enviroment 
- Cloud Provider: AWS
- Operating System: Linux
- Database: SQLite
- ec2 derived

### The Big Picture
1. System logs are generated by the host (e.g, SSH authentication logs)
2. A log collection services breaks down and analyzes relevant events
3. Events are stored in a local SQLite database
4. Detection rules evaluate stored events
5. Alerts are generated when rule conditions are met
6. ALerts can be viewed via dashboard.
